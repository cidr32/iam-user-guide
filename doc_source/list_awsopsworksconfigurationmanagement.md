## Actions Defined by AWS OpsWorks Configuration Management<a name="awsopsworksconfigurationmanagement-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.
