## Actions Defined by Amazon Kinesis Firehose<a name="amazonkinesisfirehose-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.

| Actions | Description | Access Level | Resource Types \(\*required\) | Condition Keys | Dependent Actions | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|   [ CreateDeliveryStream ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeliveryStream.html)  | Creates a delivery stream\. | Write |  |  |  | 
|   [ DeleteDeliveryStream ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDeliveryStream.html)  | Deletes a delivery stream and its data\. | Write |   [ deliverystream\* ](#amazonkinesisfirehose-deliverystream)   |  |  | 
|   [ DescribeDeliveryStream ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDeliveryStream.html)  | Describes the specified delivery stream and gets the status\. | List |  |  |  | 
|   [ ListDeliveryStreams ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeliveryStreams.html)  | Lists your delivery streams\. | List |  |  |  |

|   [ PutRecordBatch ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecordBatch.html)  | Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call, which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single records\. | Write |   [ deliverystream\* ](#amazonkinesisfirehose-deliverystream)   |  |  |

## Resources Defined by Firehose<a name="amazonkinesisfirehose-resources-for-iam-policies"></a>

The following resource types are defined by this service and can be used in the `Resource` element of IAM permission policy statements\. Each action in the [Actions table](#amazonkinesisfirehose-actions-as-permissions) identifies the resource types that can be specified with that action\. A resource type can also define which condition keys you can include in a policy\. These keys are displayed in the last column of the table\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Resource Types Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#resources_table)\.
