# Amazon EC2: Allows Starting or Stopping EC2 Instances a User Has Tagged, Programmatically and in the Console<a name="reference_policies_examples_ec2_tag-owner"></a>

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows an IAM user to start or stop EC2 instances, but only if the instance tag `Owner` has the value of that user's user name\. This policy also grants the necessary permissions to complete this action on the console\.
