## I Can't Assume a Role<a name="troubleshoot_roles_cant-assume-role"></a>

Check the following:
+ Make sure to use the exact name of your role, because role names are case sensitive\.
+ Verify that your IAM policy grants you permission to call `sts:AssumeRole` for the role that you want to assume\. The `Action` element of your IAM policy must allow you to call the `AssumeRole` action\. In addition, the `Resource` element of your IAM policy must specify the role that you want to assume\. For example, the `Resource` element can specify a role by its Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) or by a wildcard \(\*\)\. For example, at least one policy applicable to you must grant permissions similar to the following:

  ```
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account_id_number:role/role-name-you-want-to-assume"
  ```
+ Verify that your IAM identity is tagged with any tags that the IAM policy requires\. For example, in the following policy permissions, the `Condition` element requires that you, as the principal requesting to assume the role, must have a specific tag\. You must be tagged with `department = HR` or `department = CS`\. Otherwise, you cannot assume the role\. To learn about tagging IAM users and roles, see [Tagging IAM Users and Roles](id_tags.md)\.

  ```
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"aws:PrincipalTag/department": [
              "HR",
              "CS"
          ]}}
  ```
+ Verify that you meet all the conditions that are specified in the role's trust policy\. A `Condition` can specify an expiration date, an external ID, or that a request must come only from specific IP addresses\. Consider the following example: If the current date is any time after the specified date, then the policy never matches and cannot grant you the permission to assume the role\.

  ```
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account_id_number:role/role-name-you-want-to-assume"
      "Condition": {
          "DateLessThan" : {
              "aws:CurrentTime" : "2016-05-01T12:00:00Z"
          }
      }
  ```
+ Verify that the AWS account from which you are calling `AssumeRole` is a trusted entity for the role that you are assuming\. Trusted entities are defined as a `Principal` in a role's trust policy\. The following example is a trust policy that is attached to the role that you want to assume\. In this example, the account ID with the IAM user that you signed in with must be 123456789012\. If your account number is not listed in the `Principal` element of the role's trust policy, then you cannot assume the role\. It does not matter what permissions are granted to you in access policies\. Note that the example policy limits permissions to actions that occur between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017 \(UTC\), inclusive\. If you log in before or after those dates, then the policy does not match, and you cannot assume the role\. 

  ```
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "DateGreaterThan": {"aws:CurrentTime": "2017-07-01T00:00:00Z"},
        "DateLessThan": {"aws:CurrentTime": "2017-12-31T23:59:59Z"}
      }
  ```

## A New Role Appeared in My AWS Account<a name="troubleshoot_roles_new-role-appeared"></a>

Some AWS services require that you use a unique type of service role that is linked directly to the service\. This [service\-linked role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role) is predefined by the service and includes all the permissions that the service requires\. This makes setting up a service easier because you donâ€™t have to manually add the necessary permissions\. For general information about service\-linked roles, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.

You might already be using a service when it begins supporting service\-linked roles\. If so, you might receive an email telling you about a new role in your account\. This role includes all the permissions that the service needs to perform actions on your behalf\. You don't need to take any action to support this role\. However, you should not delete the role from your account\. Doing so could remove permissions that the service needs to access AWS resources\. You can view the service\-linked roles in your account by going to the IAM **Roles** page of the IAM console\. Service\-linked roles appear with **\(Service\-linked role\)** in the **Trusted entities** column of the table\.

For information about which services support service\-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md) and look for the services that have **Yes **in the **Service\-Linked Role** column\. For information about using the service\-linked role for a service, choose the **Yes** link\.

## I Can't Edit or Delete a Role in My AWS Account<a name="troubleshoot_roles_cant-edit-delete-role"></a>

You cannot delete or edit the permissions for a [service\-linked role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role) in IAM\. These roles include predefined trusts and permissions that are required by the service in order to perform actions on your behalf\. You can use the IAM console, AWS CLI, or API to edit only the description of a service\-linked role\. You can view the service\-linked roles in your account by going to the IAM **Roles** page in the console\. Service\-linked roles appear with **\(Service\-linked role\)** in the **Trusted entities** column of the table\. A banner on the role's **Summary** page also indicates that the role is a service\-linked role\. You can manage and delete these roles only through the linked service, if that service supports the action\. Be careful when modifying or deleting a service\-linked role because doing so could remove permissions that the service needs to access AWS resources\. 

For information about which services support service\-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md) and look for the services that have **Yes **in the **Service\-Linked Role** column\. 

## I'm Not Authorized to Perform: iam:PassRole<a name="troubleshoot_roles_not-auth-passrole"></a>

When you create a service\-linked role, you must have permission to pass that role to the service\. Some services automatically create a service\-linked role in your account when you perform an action in that service\. For example, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates the `AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling` service\-linked role for you the first time that you create an Auto Scaling group\. If you try to create an Auto Scaling group without the `PassRole` permission, you receive the following error:

`ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutLifecycleHook operation: User: arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/Testrole/Diego is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling`

To fix this error, ask your administrator to add the `iam:PassRole` permission for you\.

To learn which services support service\-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md)\. To learn whether a service automatically creates a service\-linked role for you, choose the **Yes** link to view the service\-linked role documentation for the service\.

## Why Can't I Assume a Role with a 12\-Hour Session? \(AWS CLI, AWS API\)<a name="troubleshoot_roles_cant-set-session"></a>

When you use the AWS STS `AssumeRole*` API or `assume-role*` CLI operations to assume a role, you can specify a value for the `DurationSeconds` parameter\. You can specify a value from 900 seconds \(15 minutes\) up to the **Maximum CLI/API session duration** setting for the role\. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails\. This setting can have a maximum value of 12 hours\. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails\. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role](id_roles_use.md#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)\. 

If you use [*role chaining*](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-role-chaining) \(using a role to assume a second role\), your session is limited to a maximum of one hour\. If you then use the `DurationSeconds` parameter to provide a value greater than one hour, the operation fails\. 

## My Role Has a Policy That Allows Me to Perform an Action, But I Get "Access Denied"<a name="troubleshoot_roles_session-policy"></a>

Your role session might be limited by session policies\. When you [request temporary security credentials](id_credentials_temp_request.md) programmatically using AWS STS, you can optionally pass inline or managed [session policies](access_policies.md#policies_session)\. Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary credential session for a role\. You can pass a single JSON inline session policy document using the `Policy` parameter\. You can use the `PolicyArns` parameter to specify up to 10 managed session policies\. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity\-based policies and the session policies\. Alternatively, if your administrator or a custom program provides you with temporary credentials, they might have included a session policy to limit your access\.
