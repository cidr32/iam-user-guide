## Actions Defined by Amazon Transcribe<a name="amazontranscribe-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. Use policies to grant permissions to perform an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\.

The **Resource Types** column indicates whether each action supports resource\-level permissions\. If there is no value for this column, you must specify all resources \("\*"\) in the `Resource` element of your policy statement\. If the column includes a resource type, then you can specify an ARN of that type in a statement with that action\. Required resources are indicated in the table with an asterisk \(\*\)\. If you specify a resource\-level permission ARN in a statement using this action, then it must be of this type\. Some actions support multiple resource types\. If the resource type is optional \(not indicated as required\), then you can choose to use one but not the other\.

For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.
