## Actions Defined by AWS Support<a name="awssupport-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.

AWS Support does not let you allow or deny access to individual actions; therefore your policy must use the `"Action": "support:*"` to use the AWS Support Center or to use the AWS Support API\. In addition, when you use the AWS Support API to call Trusted Advisor\-related actions \(such as `DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks`\), none of the `trustedadvisor` actions restrict your access\. The `trustedadvisor` actions apply only to Trusted Advisor in the AWS Management Console\.
