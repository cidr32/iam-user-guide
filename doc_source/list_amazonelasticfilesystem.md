## Actions Defined by Amazon Elastic File System<a name="amazonelasticfilesystem-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.

## Resources Defined by EFS<a name="amazonelasticfilesystem-resources-for-iam-policies"></a>

The following resource types are defined by this service and can be used in the `Resource` element of IAM permission policy statements\. Each action in the [Actions table](#amazonelasticfilesystem-actions-as-permissions) identifies the resource types that can be specified with that action\. A resource type can also define which condition keys you can include in a policy\. These keys are displayed in the last column of the table\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Resource Types Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#resources_table)\.

| Resource Types | ARN | Condition Keys | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|   [ file\-system ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/access-control-overview.html#access-control-resources)  |  arn:$\{Partition\}:elasticfilesystem:$\{Region\}:$\{Account\}:file\-system/$\{FileSystemId\}  |  | 

## Condition Keys for Amazon Elastic File System<a name="amazonelasticfilesystem-policy-keys"></a>

EFS has no service\-specific context keys that can be used in the `Condition` element of policy statements\. For the list of the global context keys that are available to all services, see [Available Keys for Conditions](reference_policies_condition-keys.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM Policy Reference*\.
