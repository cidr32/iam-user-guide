## Actions Defined by Amazon API Gateway<a name="amazonapigateway-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.


****  

| Actions | Description | Access Level | Resource Types \(\*required\) | Condition Keys | Dependent Actions | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|   [ InvalidateCache ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/api-gateway-caching.html)  | Used to invalidate API cache upon a client request | Write |   [ execute\-api\-general\* ](#amazonapigateway-execute-api-general)   |  |  | 
|   [ Invoke ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/how-to-call-api.html)  | Used to invoke an API upon a client request | Write |   [ execute\-api\-general\* ](#amazonapigateway-execute-api-general)   |  |  | 

## Resources Defined by ExecuteAPI<a name="amazonapigateway-resources-for-iam-policies"></a>

The following resource types are defined by this service and can be used in the `Resource` element of IAM permission policy statements\. Each action in the [Actions table](#amazonapigateway-actions-as-permissions) identifies the resource types that can be specified with that action\. A resource type can also define which condition keys you can include in a policy\. These keys are displayed in the last column of the table\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Resource Types Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#resources_table)\.

| Resource Types | ARN | Condition Keys | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|   execute\-api\-general  |  arn:$\{Partition\}:execute\-api:$\{Region\}:$\{Account\}:$\{ApiId\}/$\{Stage\}/$\{Method\}/$\{ApiSpecificResourcePath\}  |  | 

## Condition Keys for Amazon API Gateway<a name="amazonapigateway-policy-keys"></a>

ExecuteAPI has no service\-specific context keys that can be used in the `Condition` element of policy statements\. For the list of the global context keys that are available to all services, see [Available Keys for Conditions](reference_policies_condition-keys.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM Policy Reference*\.
