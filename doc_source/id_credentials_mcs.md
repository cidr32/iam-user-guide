# Using IAM with Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service<a name="id_credentials_mcs"></a>

Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service \(MCS\) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandraâ€“compatible database service\. You can access MCS using the AWS Management Console, by running a `cqlsh` client, or using an Apache 2\.0 licensed Cassandra driver\. 

**Note**  
If you plan to interact with MCS only through the console, you don't need to generate service\-specific credentials\. For more information, see [Accessing Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service Using the Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mcs/latest/devguide/console_MCS.html) in the *Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service Developer Guide*\.

You must generate service\-specific credentials to allow your users to access MCS using `cqlsh` or an Apache 2\.0 licensed Cassandra driver\. *Service\-specific credentials* allow an IAM user to interact with one AWS service, but no others\. 

For more information about the permissions required to access MCS, see [Generating Service\-Specific Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mcs/latest/devguide/accessing.html#ssc) in the *Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service Developer Guide*\.
