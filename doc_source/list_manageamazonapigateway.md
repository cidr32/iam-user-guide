## Actions Defined by Manage Amazon API Gateway<a name="manageamazonapigateway-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.

| Actions | Description | Access Level | Resource Types \(\*required\) | Condition Keys | Dependent Actions | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|   [ DELETE ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/API_DELETE.html)  | Used to delete resources | Write |   [ apigateway\-general\* ](#manageamazonapigateway-apigateway-general)   |  |  |

|   [ HEAD ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/API_HEAD.html)  | Same as GET but does not return the resource representation\. Used in testing scenarios | Read |   [ apigateway\-general\* ](#manageamazonapigateway-apigateway-general)   |  |  |

## Resources Defined by API Gateway<a name="manageamazonapigateway-resources-for-iam-policies"></a>

The following resource types are defined by this service and can be used in the `Resource` element of IAM permission policy statements\. Each action in the [Actions table](#manageamazonapigateway-actions-as-permissions) identifies the resource types that can be specified with that action\. A resource type can also define which condition keys you can include in a policy\. These keys are displayed in the last column of the table\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Resource Types Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#resources_table)\.

| Resource Types | ARN | Condition Keys |

## Condition Keys for Manage Amazon API Gateway<a name="manageamazonapigateway-policy-keys"></a>

API Gateway has no service\-specific context keys that can be used in the `Condition` element of policy statements\. For the list of the global context keys that are available to all services, see [Available Keys for Conditions](reference_policies_condition-keys.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM Policy Reference*\.
